# Environs
This is a place to get support and discuss features for the Environs iOS app. 
The smart clock that keeps you informed and puts you and your guests in control. 
Show the time, date and any collection of HomeKit temperature, humidity and 
lighting/power information. Give yourself and your guests control over your HomeKit 
controlled smart lights for a whole room or individual lights & power switches.


The app is available from the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/environs/id6470208021) 
for iPhone and iPad.
